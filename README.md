# dHating
#### A dating app that connects people based on their common dislikes

Ever tried to meet someone new and realized you don't have anything in common? This app aims to solve that problem, and create topics of conversation that help conversation flow.

There's a matching system that shows you only people who have disliked the same things as you. Proximity is the next implementation, grabbing your location and setting a radius for people who can be discovered.

Users can match and a chat will instantly be opened. I intend to implement SocketIO in the future.

This project was created in 6 days, completely from scratch and without any RN/Expo knowledge.

Have fun dHating!
