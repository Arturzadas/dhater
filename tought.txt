TODO

upload or login
  set the user object as App.js state in order to make it accesible to every component from then on (useContext or something similar)
  create the upload interface / use firestore and find system to display correct images
  create a few topics/questions and create a screen for them
  each user should have a 'progress' number associated to it, so we can know if he's uploaded the image and answered the dislike questions
  start styling the app properly!
